            This is a machine equipped with sensors which are monitored by
            Arduino a programable logic controller. It is a stress-release model
            designed for all frustrated students who are overwhelmed with school
            work. To release stress student can shout and beat at the machine
            racking up points and measuring their galvanic skin response This
            was a school project that was undertaken in order to understand how
            program microcontrollers and how to use the sensor readings to
            create an interactive machine.

            The development tie for this project was 2 weeks. My role for this
            project was the developer. My partner Jamie Zhang and David Lee
            would do the schematics and physical model. Because we were all on
            point with our task assigned, we were able to meet the deadline
            comfortably.

            The issue I face with my task was finding a way to get retrieve the
            sensor input I wanted. Because we used 3 sensors in our machine
            there would always be moments where we would get multiple sensor
            reading at the same time from different sensors. To get around this,
            I looked up online and figured out that I just need to make each
            sensor values unique. If I add a different character in front and at
            the end of each reading from the different sensors I could then
            parse it later since the reading are now unique to each sensors.
            Allowing me to get the specific readings I want to add certain
            interactions to the machine

            For the first prototype, we were not required to have any of the
            visualization components yet and so I wanted to make sure we were
            getting all the sensor readings correctly from Arduino. We had 3
            sensors sound, pressure, and galvanic. I made sure values were
            varying depending on the input. After that, our team just fit all
            the sensors and circuit into a demo housing to showcase that our
            sensors were working. Because all the sensors were working fine the
            feedback we received was that our project needed to be fitted into
            something sturdy that could take some abuse. So for the final
            iteration we made sure to have our project weighted down. We also
            linked the sensor reading to a visualization so users could easily
            follow their progress.

            During the final showcase, people were very interested in the idea
            of the project and wanted to get the highest score. We found that
            people were really competitive. If I were to do the project again I
            were create a leaderboard or some sort.
