                    This was created for a university group project in
                    order to understand the principles of user interface design. The goal was to understand the necessary
                    steps from start to finish defining goals, to doing market research, to creating iterative prototypes. </p>

                <span class="dash"> </span>
                <p>Our project timeline was 3 weeks. My role for this project was mainly the developer interface
                    designer. My partners Zax Chen and Liv Bennet were the main graphic and interface designers. As the
                    developer, my responsibility for my team was to let my team know which interface was feasible and
                    what’s not since I had little experience in mobile development.</p>

                <h2> The Problem</h2>
                <span class="dash"> </span>
                <p>The course doesn’t teach how to make mobile app only how to design it and I was the only mobile
                    developer
                    and I wasn’t very experienced at it. With the scarce timeline given I had to figure out everything
                    from the
                    layout to implementing a sensor to the app as a mandatory requirement for the project. I could not
                    use any mobile prototyping tool since a sensor was involved. However, In my attempt of desperately
                    searching I had come across a tool called ProtoPie that allowed mobile sensor implementation in the
                    prototype. This discovery freed up a lot of time resource that allowed me focus more on the
                    interface design and time to conduct a heuristic evaluation to gain feedback on our product.</p>

            <div>
                <p class="text-cell">For the first prototype, we were not required to have any of the visualization components yet and so I wanted to make sure we were getting all the sensor readings correctly from Arduino. We had 3 sensors sound, pressure, and galvanic. I made sure values were varying depending on the input. After that, our team just fit all the sensors and circuit into a demo housing to showcase that our sensors were working. Because all the sensors were working fine the feedback we received was that our project needed to be fitted into something sturdy that could take some abuse. So for the final iteration we made sure to have our project weighted down. We also linked the sensor reading to a visualization so users could easily follow their progress.</p>

                <p class="text-cell">During the course of this project, I’ve applied and extended a lot of what I have learned in Interactive Arts and Technology. The design process of ideating to market research and user testing. The takeaway for me in this project is that I shouldn’t panic if I do not know how to do something. There are a lot of resources everywhere and I just need to know where to look for it.
                    <br><br>
                    At the end at the final showcase, many people enjoyed our app and liked the interface. We received nearly a perfect mark for this project.
